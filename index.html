    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>A sportive boy from Taiwan. Currently living in Germany. <br />
        Most of the time I'm pretty chill but sometimes I could be a hot mess according to my mom. <br />
        Believe it or not, my birthday is the same as my mom's. 
        We celebrate our birthdays on the 18th of September. 
        My mom makes the most délicieuxxx doggy cake in the world! <br />
        Well, I'm proud to be a mama's boy! <br />

    <h2>Travel Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Breeze Dog Park - Taipei City, Taiwan
            <ul>
                <li>It is my favorite Dog park in Taiwan. We go there almost 3 times per week!</li>
                <li>Sometimes you can see huge packs of Huskies or Golden Retrievers! Gosh, I hate them!</li>
                <li>Whenever we go there, we stay at the booth which is located all the way in the back. Mom jokingly named it 龍位!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>Liepee Pond - Yilan County, Taiwan
            <ul>
                <li>This location is such a hidden gem!</li>
                <li>There are so many beautiful pine trees and the lake is just so beautiful!</li>
                <li>It is located inside a big cemetary. It could be spooky sometimes. But the advantage is that there's not many people around which normally makes me anxious.</li>
                <li>The biggest downside is the traffic to get there. Gotta sit in the car for 1.5 hours cuz the traffic jam.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>Dog Boss Resort - Taoyuan County, Taiwan
            <ul>
                <li>Mama always order meat balls for me! Miam Miam!</li>
                <li>There's a big grass yard for me to run!</li>
                <li>I had my first swimming experience here, but I hated it!</li>
                <li>Mom and I met many doggie friends here! Xiaobai for example!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>QingPu Park - Taoyuan County, Taiwan
            <ul>
                <li>Xiaobai introduced us to this amazing park!</li>
                <li>Mom said that there are plenty of spaces for parking!</li>
                <li>It's so spacious that I can relax and sniff as much as I want!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>BTB Football Field - Oldenburg, Germany
            <ul>
                <li>When there's no one on the field, I could run freely on it!</li>
                <li>Sometimes I get to play with other dogs. But it's quiet rarely because Germans don't like letting their dogs to play with other dogs. Meh...</li> 
                <li>The downside of this location is that it is located in the hot-zone. The atmosphere around could be quiet strange. Once we were chased by a weird woman. Gosh!</li>
                <li>And from April to August, dogs are forbidden to run freely here. Because the gov is protecting some kind of birds which I've never seen. Maybe imaginary birdies? Who knows!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br />

        <li>Industrial Place - Oldenburg, Germany
            <ul>
                <li>It's pretty calm on the weekends. </li>
                <li>It's an alternative option for me to do sport when we can't do it at BTB. </li>
                <li>But recently there are more and more people coming to this place on the weekends. So my mama is trying to figure out a new time slot for us to avoid people.</li>
                <li>Oh! Almost to forgot to mention that there are many rabbits in this zone! I wish that one day my mom would allow me to chase them! Bitte Mutti!!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
